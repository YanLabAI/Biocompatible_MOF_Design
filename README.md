# Machine Learning-Assisted Discovery of Biocompatible Metal-Organic Frameworks

This repository contains the data and code for the manuscript titled: "Machine Learning-Assisted Discovery of Biocompatible Metal Organic Frameworks Using Simulation Data and Toxicological Profiles: Adsorptive Removal of Benzene Series Pollutants from Water".

This project develops and applies a machine learning framework to identify novel, high-performance, and biocompatible Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for environmental remediation. The framework focuses on two primary predictive tasks:
1.  Predicting the adsorption capacities of MOFs for benzene and toluene.
2.  Developing models to predict the aquatic toxicity of MOF organic linkers and classify their environmental risk (PMT/vPvM).
